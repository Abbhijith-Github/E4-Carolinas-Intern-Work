# E4-Carolinas-Intern-Work
This folder subsumes all the work done while interning at E4 Carolinas - developed a dynamic ED model for Duke Energy operated plants + Solar & Biomass IPP using publicly available datasets. Also developed a ED model for energy storage. To get clarity, please review the PDFs to know the i/p and o/p files, model description, methodology, results, and more. 
TABLEAU Viz - nuclear companies identified globally, in SouthEast US, and finally per product level.
